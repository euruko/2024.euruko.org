            Speed up your Ruby applications with the power of concurrency!
Join us as we demystify threads, fibers, and Ractors, understanding
their unique strengths, use cases, and impact on Ruby performance.

ing your code’s speed.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            For a very long time, Ruby had limited options for concurrency, mainly relying
on threads, which developers often dreaded. However, with the exciting updates
introduced in Ruby 3.0, the fiber scheduler and Ractors provided a remarkable
3x performance boost. Despite these advancements, few have used these features
in production. But now, we can confidently say that they are ready for use.
