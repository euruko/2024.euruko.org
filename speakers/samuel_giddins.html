            RubyGems, like any sufficiently-used piece of software, has its fair
share of bugs. Being a package manager (and gem host), many of
those bugs turn out to have security implications. Let’s take a tour
of recent RubyGems & RubyGems.org vulnerabilities, and learn how
we’re keeping the ecosystem safe.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            Marshal, insufficient input validation, symlink traversal, oh my! Over the past
            couple of years, there’s been a slow trickle of CVEs announced, covering both
            RubyGems & RubyGems.org. Let’s go on a quick tour of those vulnerabilities,
            covering their lifecycle from discovery to mitigation to announcement. We’ll
            dive into some patterns that have started to emerge, and discuss the steps the
            RubyGems team is taking to keep the Ruby ecosystem secure in an increasingly
            adversarial world.

            Samuel is the Security Engineer in Residence at Ruby Central, leading security
efforts across RubyGems and RubyGems.org by day (and sometimes by night,
CVEs never sleep). He’s been working on Ruby tooling for the past decade, and
has shipped hundreds of bugs across RubyGems & Bundler.
