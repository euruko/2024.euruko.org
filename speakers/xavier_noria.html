            Last month marked the 5th anniversary of Rails 6, the first Rails
            version to ship with Zeitwerk. In this talk, we'll do a
            retrospective about the Zeitwerk project. We are going to
            understand its motivations, technical details, milestones, API
            design, and other topics.
