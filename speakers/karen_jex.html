          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            Your database is configured for the needs of your day-to-day application
activity, but what if you need to run complex analytics queries
against your application data? Let’s look at how you can optimise
your database for an analytics workload without compromising the
performance of your application.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            Data analytics still isn’t always done in a dedicated analytics database. The
business wants to glean insights and value from the data that’s generated over
time by your OLTP applications, and the simplest way to do that is often just
to run analytics queries directly on your application database.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            Of course, this almost certainly involves running complex queries, joining data
from multiple tables, and working on large data sets. If your database and code
are optimised for performance of your day-to-day application activity, you’re
likely to slow down your application and find yourself with analytics queries
that take far too long to run.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            In this talk, we’ll discuss the challenges associated with running data analytics
on an existing application database. We’ll look at some of the impacts this type
of workload could have on the application, and why it could cause the analytics
queries themselves to perform poorly.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            We’ll then look at a number of different strategies, tools and techniques that can
            prevent the two workloads from impacting each other. We will look at things
            such as architecture choices, configuration parameters, materialized views and
            external tools.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            The focus will be on PostgreSQL, but most of the concepts are relevant to other
database systems.

            Karen was a database administrator for over 20 years and was once described
as “quite personable for a DBA”, which she decided to take as a compliment!
She’s now a Senior Solutions Architect, helping her customers to design and
manage their (PostgreSQL) database environments.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            Karen gives talks about databases at PostgreSQL and developer conferences
because she loves sharing knowledge. She is also on the PostgreSQL Europe
board and helps to organise various PostgreSQL community events.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            When she’s not playing with databases, Karen can either be found crocheting
cute gifts for her friends, or out on one of her bikes enjoying the mountains
where she lives with her family.
