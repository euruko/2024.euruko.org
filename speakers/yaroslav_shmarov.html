            My name is Yaroslav Shmarov. I like sharing my knowledge and learnings to
empower and enable others in their journey.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            I have created 5 best-selling top-rated Udemy courses, with over 5000 student
enrolments so far. My courses are beginner-friendly code-alongs, where you get
to build a complete app from zero.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            Also, I created a youtube channel about Ruby on Rails named SupeRails with
over 150 screencasts. In my videos I try to explain concepts in minutes, that
otherwise would have taken days or weeks to learn.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            I also write a “dev log” blog, where I document the most interesting, most
challenging daily programming challenges I overcome at work. I think that writing a “dev log” and documenting learnings helps with structuring knowledge.
It helped me become 10x dev vs who I was.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            When Hotwire was released, I was working at a startup that used Rails,
GraphQL and React. We were early adopters of Hotwire, and we completely
rewrote our application into a Rails monolith with server-side rendering with
Hotwire and ViewComponent for the design system. The frontend had a lot of
complex UI interactions that were previously done with React, and I had the
opportunity to solve complex problems with Hotwire, Kredis, ViewComponent,
StimulusJS, RequestJS. Since then I have worked as a “Frontend owner” with
different companies, where my role was to create complex UI’s with Hotwire.
While working with the technology, I had identified multiple common-use
patterns and best practices, that I can talk about.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            By the way, I never got a CS degree. I got a degree in marketing, but switched
to programming. I am self-taught. Initially I tried out Ruby on Rails, because
I needed a “School Management web app” for my business. I could not find a
good one on the market, so I decided to build one. With no prior experience,
Rails was very fast to learn. I was amazed by scaffolds, associations, devise
and Heroku - it’s all I really needed to worry about when building my app!
That’s what I call Rails magic - being able to jump in and build something that
provides business value with minimal experience!
