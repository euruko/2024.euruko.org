            Attendees will leave with a roadmap for integrating AI tools and techniques
into their projects, insights into the potential pitfalls and best practices, and
inspiration to explore the boundaries of what a single developer or a small team
can achieve with the right tools. The presenter is a well-known Ruby on Rails
expert and his latest book, “Patterns of Application Development Using AI” is
the definitive tome on the subject.
