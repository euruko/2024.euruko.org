            In this talk, we will explore the fascinating journey from the conception of
Crystal to its current state as an elegant and efficient programming language.
Through concrete examples and detailed analysis, we will see how Ruby has
influenced the creation and evolution of Crystal, from syntax to fundamental
concepts.

            Things that will bring to the talk. + Brief overview of Crystal and its place in
the programming language landscape. + Exploration of how key principles and
features of Ruby have influenced the design of Crystal. + Comparison of the
similarities and differences in syntax and semantics between Ruby and Crystal.
+ Analysis of how Ruby’s design principles, such as readability and expres-
siveness, have been integrated into Crystal. + Discussion on how Crystal has
evolved and diverged from Ruby to meet its own needs and goals. + Practical
examples of how Ruby has influenced problem-solving and feature implementa-
tion in Crystal. + Reflection on the future of Crystal and how Ruby’s influence

            My full name is Rafael PEÑA-AZAR. Born in Colombia. Software engineer.
Ruby/Rails evangelizer. Systems Engineering professional. I have a Master’s
degree in Web Engineering from Universidad Internacional de La Rioja (España)
where I obtained the highest qualification in my degree thesis (with a project
focused on RubyOnRails developers). Also, certified in Software Quality Man-
agement. Passionate coder. Sometimes public speaker. Teacher/Mentor. Love
all about Ruby (and Rails). Crazy about Hotwire. I’m also enthusiast about
Crystal and the Amber framework; and outside of the Ruby ecosystem I like
Elixir and Phoenix very much. Married since 2017. Father of 2. Overall, a
friendly guy and a family man.
