            We love writing Ruby code but, what if I tell you that sometimes the
answer is not writing more Ruby code but removing it?Learn how
to improve the performance of your app by leveraging other parts of
your application that are usually neglected. For this episode, we’ll
focus on the database
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            I’ll show some comparisons between common problems solved by using a pure
Ruby implementation and its counterpart with a more db-oriented solution. I’ll
also demonstrate how we can take advantage of databases such redis, neo4j and
Cassandra as well as other additional tools that can make of life easier such
elasticsearch.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            The outcome of the talk is that attendees will have a guide to spot what features
of their application can be a good fit for a database-oriented solution instead of
a code-oriented solution.
