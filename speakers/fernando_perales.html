          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            I’ll present some of the advantages of gRPC such as duplex stream-
ing, auto generated client code, connection pool and first class load
balancing, and how it can be applied.I’ll also talk about the main
disadvantages of implementing gRPC in an existing codebase.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            gRPC has been around for a while and, even though it’s neither a replacement
of REST nor a better option for building APIs, it is an alternative that can be
useful in certain cases where we can benefit from lightweight messages, built-in
code generation and high performance. In this talk I’ll share the concepts, pros
and cons, and use cases of gRPC with examples in Ruby.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            We’ll start with a quick refresher on HTTP and REST. We’ll move along with
an introduction to gRPC/protobuf architecture and we will go through a demo
on how to integrate gRPC in our Ruby applications and how to make it com-
municate with a Go service and we’ll wrap up our session with some use cases
where you may consider using gRPC instead of a REST API
