          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            Ruby is getting better/faster every day thanks to YJIT, GC en-
hancements, and other updates. Yet, some domains hit the perfor-
mance barrier, and what to do when that happens?In this talk, I’ll
show how to build a production-ready Ruby gem with a Rust native
extension and discuss the pros and cons.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            2024 is such a great time to be a Ruby developer! The language is getting better
and faster everyday with initiatives like YJIT, enhanced GC, and Prism.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            Even when we face the language bounderies, we no longer need to default to
C, it’s easier than ever extending ours gems using the modern and fast tooling
that Rust ecosystem brings.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            In this talk, I’m going to share my journey at Shopify creating a Ruby gem with
a Rust native extension, the advantages, challenges, best practices, and how to
avoid common pitfalls.

            Hey! I’m Guilherme!
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            Although Ruby is my favorite language, it wasn’t the first one I learned. I
started programming with Pascal over 20 years ago when my uncle taught me.
That’s when I discovered my lifelong passion for creating things with code.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            Currently, I work as a staff dev at Shopify, where I build tools for other devel-
opers who create themes in Liquid. My responsibilities range from the CLI and
the Liquid language server running on their machines to the infrastructure that
showcases their work in storefronts.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            Prior to Shopify, I spent five great years at Red Hat, focusing on open-source
tooling for the DMN and BPMN specs. That was all about making life easier
for developers too.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            I’m always eager to connect with folks and talk about developer tooling or good
restaurants. Let’s chat! :)
