            “A rebuild is never finished, only started” “It takes 3 times as long
as you expect to rewrite a system” You’re not supposed to do purely
technical rebuilds but where’s the fun in that? Come hear about
why I decided to do it and what I learnt. It’s either the best or
worst decision I ever made.

          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            “A rebuild is never finished, only started” “Technical rebuilds are doomed to
fail” “One does not simply walk into Mordor”

            We’re rebuilding Culture Amp’s second largest product - Performance. It’s 9
years old, came in as a Series A acquisition 5 years ago, has over 2700 customers
with the largest one at 77k users. Against conventional wisdom, we’re rebuilding
it from the ground up with an aggressive timeline. The underlying model is
outdated, slow to iterate on, and not extensible. The monoliths are riddled
with tech debt, tightly coupled, patched and band-aided over many times, and
won’t scale to the $3b global Performance market we’re targeting.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            That wasn’t challenging enough already I’m also using this opportunity to
rebuild our engineering culture. Setting a high bar for engineering standards,
ways of working, and hoping to improve engagement as we go.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            In this talk, I’ll share: - How I came to this decision - How we got buy in from
Exec and the Board for a purely technical rebuild - How we tried to set up for
success, our principles and standards - Where we failed - Where we succeeded
- Lessons that could be useful for anyone thinking about rebuilding a product
that’s hampering speed and hindering your ability to innovate or deliver value
to your customers.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            The rebuild is still in progress. I don’t have all the answers (or any!). But we’ve
already learned much - what to do, what not to do, and where the spiders are
hiding.
