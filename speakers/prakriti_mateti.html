            We're rebuilding Culture Amp's second largest product -
            Performance. It came in as a Series A acquisition 5 years ago and
            has thousands of customers today with the largest one at 77k users.
            Against conventional wisdom, we're rebuilding it from the ground up
            with an aggressive timeline. The underlying model is outdated, slow
            to iterate on, and not extensible. The monoliths are riddled with
            tech debt, tightly coupled, patched and band-aided over many times,
            and won't take us towards the $3b global Performance market we're
            targeting.

            That wasn't challenging enough already so I'm also using this
            opportunity to rebuild our engineering culture. Setting a high bar
            for engineering standards, ways of working, and hoping to improve
            engagement as we go.

            In this talk, I'll share:

                How I came to this decision
              </li>
              <li class="section__article__list__item is-accepted">
                How we got buy in from Exec and the Board for a technical
                rebuild
              </li>
              <li class="section__article__list__item is-accepted">
                How we tried to set up for success, our principles and
                standards

              <li class="section__article__list__item is-accepted">

                Lessons that could be useful for anyone thinking about
                rebuilding a product that's hampering speed and hindering your
                ability to innovate or deliver value to your customers.

            The rebuild is still in progress. I don't have all the answers (or
            any!). But we've already learned much - what to do, what not to do,
            and where the spiders are hiding.
