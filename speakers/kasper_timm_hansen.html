            There's a treasure trove of code that you could learn from hiding in plain sight: Open Source.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            By reading other people's code you can pick up new tricks, names, and concepts â€” and apply them to your code. You can even be exposed to things you'd never think of.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            My journey reading <i>Open Source for the hell of it</i> started back in 2013, when I set out to read all of Rails as a Google Summer of Code student.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
          Join this session to see how I've grown my skills through reading and have the process demystified so you can too. You'll walk away knowing how to start breaking into even the gnarliest codebases.
