            The author of Langchain.rb will walk you through current capabilities
of LLMs and what can be built today. We will build a business
process automation AI agent in Ruby and discuss the common pitfalls
and misconceptions. We’ll discuss what might be emerging as
a new LLM-powered software stack.

            Generative AI has been taking the world by storm. The Coatue AI (Nov 2023)
report is putting AI models at the centerpiece of all modern tech stacks going
forward that Application Developers will be using to build on top of. It would
not be controversial to say that the Ruby ecosystem lacks in its support and
understanding of the AI, ML and DS landscape. If we’d like to stay relevant in
the future, we need to start building the foundations now. We’ll look at what
Generative AI is, what kind of applications developers in other communities are
building and how Ruby can be used to build similar applications today. We’ll
cover Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), vector embeddings and semantic
search, prompt engineering, and what the state of art (SOTA) in evaluating
LLM output looks like today. We will also cover AI Agents, semi-autonomous
general purpose LLM-backed applications, and what they’re capable of today.
We’ll make a case why Ruby is a great language to build these applications
because on its strengths and its incredible ecosystem. After the slides, I’ll walk
the attendees through building an AI Agent in 15 min with Langchain.rb.

            Andrei has been a software engineering professional for 13 years. Among many
others he’s been fortunate to make his impact at Spree Commerce (Acquired by
First Data), WeddingWire (IPO), FiscalNote (IPO), National Public Radio, and
USA Today. He currently runs a software dev firm, and serves as an Architect
and a Fractional CTO on the client projects. Consumed by the AI wave this
year, Andrei pondered what the future holds for Ruby in the world of evergrowing
AI/ML needs. He is the creator of Langchain.rb, an open source Ruby
library for building LLM-powered applications. In his free time he enjoys playing
tennis and going on long runs while listening to podcasts.
