          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            We started AnyCable Pro with a few Pro features on top of AnyCable, which was built as a performant replacement for Action Cable for Rails developers, and we needed to make it commercially successful for Evil Martians. So we focused on building what people wanted and saw their priorities shift from GraphQL to Hotwire, from chats to collaboration, and to AI-powered voice apps. With the initial value proposition in performance, we switched to solving data reliability in WebSockets, building session and data recovery, fallbacks and much more, to allow engineers to focus on their business logic, not the specific realtime issues. AnyCable became language and framework agnostic, with a much more simple initial setup and deploy. Finally we launched Managed AnyCable earlier this year. Letâ€™s reflect on our story three years in: what worked, what didn't, and our most precious learnings. And what does the future look like for AnyCable and realtime?

          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            The talk will weave together two narratives: our experience building and growing AnyCable Pro, and the evolution of real-time applications as we've observed.
