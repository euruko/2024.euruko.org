          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            Hands-on building Rails applications using SQLite! This workshop
offers a mix of the basics (rails new with SQLite and Solid gems,
getting backups setup, core deployment considerations, etc.) and
more advanced use-cases, like installing extensions, running multiple
databases, full-text search, etc.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            Learn how to build and deploy a Rails application using SQLite with hands-on
exercises! Together we will take a brand new Rails application and walk through
various features and enhancements to make a production-ready, full-featured
application using only SQLite. We will take advantage of SQLite’s lightweight
database files to create separate databases for our data, job queue, cache, error
monitoring, etc. We will install and use a SQLite extension to build vector
similarity search. We will setup point-in-time backups with Litestream. We
will also explore how to deploy your application. By the end of this workshop,
you will understand what kinds of applications are a good fit for SQLite, how
to build a resilient SQLite on Rails application, and how to scale to 50k+
concurrent users.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            This workshop is intended for Rails developers of all levels, though it will likely
be most valuable to developers who have pre-existing experience with building
and deploying a Rails application.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            The primary desired outcome is the developers feeling knowledgable and
comfortable with the differences and details of running a SQLite on Rails application.
Secondarily and relatedly, this workshop will provide a hands-on introduction
to the emerging SQLite+Ruby/Rails ecosystem of tools.
