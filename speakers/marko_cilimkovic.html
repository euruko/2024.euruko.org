            In the last couple of years, we’ve performed maintenance of 20+ apps with
severely outdated dependencies, and it’s safe to say we’ve learnt a few lessons
along the 500 hours we put into it.

            Join the talk to learn - the fresh approach to updating dependencies that will
help you stay ahead of the curve - what does one team have to do in order to
keep a healthy app ecosystem - and how to pitch this investment to the clients.

            I’m Marko, though most people know me as Ćilim. It’s pronounced like
“chillin’,” but with an “m” at the end. I hail from the picturesque country of
Croatia.

            My journey with Ruby began in 2014, and it’s been a passionate affair ever
since. I co-founded a company specializing in web solutions built on Ruby on
Rails, and since 2016, I’ve been a part of the Infinum Agency. Starting as a
junior developer, I steadily progressed to a leadership role. However, I recently
realized that my true passion lies in diving deep into code rather than managing
teams, prompting my transition back to a senior engineer position.

            During my downtime, you’ll often find me immersed in fantasy literature,
playing console games, watching Anime, or exploring the intricacies of the Japanese
language.
