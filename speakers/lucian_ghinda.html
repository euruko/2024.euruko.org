          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            Explore how Ruby has evolved with features like numbered params,
endless methods, and pattern matching. Let’s embrace these changes
to future-proof our code rather than sticking to old habits. You will
learn how to use the new features, when to apply them, and when
to avoid them.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            There are almost 5 years since we started seeing many new features and syntax
being added to Ruby, and still, a huge part of the developers are not using it.
We have become conservative and thus this is a protecting position and when we
focus on protecting what we have, we close in and are not focused on evolving
and the future. As Matz says in a talk, we need to push forward and adopt
new features if we want to avoid the Boredom Trap, where existing developers
are getting bored and moving out while new people are not coming in as the
language does not evolve to offer new solutions to new problems.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            Ruby has evolved a lot since Ruby 2.7 and has added a wide range of new
features that can transform both how we think about and write code.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            You may have heard about some of them: numbered block params, endless
method definition, hash literal value omission, pattern matching, object shapes,
or new stdlib/core methods and classes. These features hold immense potential,
yet most codebases do not take full advantage of them.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            The primary outcome of this talk is to show developers practical knowledge
about the new features. They will not only understand what these features do
but also when it is a good idea and a bad idea to apply them. It might be that
everybody knows about these new features, but adopting them takes work to
convince colleagues about the benefits and use cases where new features fit.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            In this talk, I will review a series of code snippets taken straight from production
and see how they can be improved using the new Ruby features while extracting
rules or guides about how and when to apply them.

          <h3 class="section__article__title has-dot">workshop: Testing: How to write fewer tests and cover more cases</h3>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            When learning Ruby or Ruby on Rails, you learn about RSpec or
Minitest and how to use the library to write model, controller, or
integration tests. Yet you don’t learn much about testing: What
is testing and how do you know that the tests you wrote will catch
bugs? How do you pick what to test?
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            There are a lot of resources out there about how to write RSpec or Minitest
and about speeding up test case execution, but there is little knowledge shared
online about how to decide what to test and how to write a good test case in
Ruby. This workshop plans to close this knowledge gap by showing easy-to-use
and practical test design techniques, all applied in Ruby and Ruby on Rails.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            I will cover test design techniques that help you write the minimum number
of tests that would cover the widest surface of your app. You will learn about
Decision Tables, Boundary Value Analysis, Equivalence Partitioning, PairWise
Testing, Decision Coverage, Statement Coverage and more, all with Ruby code
examples. You will lean how to write the minimum amount of tests while trying
to cover as much as possible the part that you are testing. All are based on
mathematically proven techniques.
