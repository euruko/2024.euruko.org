            I am a software engineer currently based in Barcelona. I have been working
primarily with Rails since the release of Rails 3, more than 10 years ago. Per-
formance optimization has been an obsession for me since I founded my first
start-up as a solo engineer in 2012. Currently, I am a Group Tech Lead and
Senior Staff Engineer at Zendesk, where I focus on performance optimization.
