          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            Content Security Policy is kind of getting hot right now. I myself felt
like it was a niche technology, just an extra layer of security against
XSS. Security experts think otherwise, and they’re now asking for
CSP during audits. So, let’s take a look at that from the developer’s
standpoint
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            Content Security Policy is a web standard and browser mechanism that improves
our security against multiple attacks, specifically XSS and data injection. It’s
pretty widespread: it has made its way into Ruby’s major tools such as Rails,
Hanami, Roda, and Bullet. Basically, if a gem adds script tags to the page –
it’ll probably have to deal with CSP one way or another.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            However, introducing an extra level of security brings its own challenges and
limitations. How do we decide on the level of security we want? How do we limit
the impact on developers? How do we safely roll out the changes? HOW do
we work with static pages? Lots of general questions and a lot of more specific
ones.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            We’ll talk about the principles and specifics of introducing CSP into existing
systems. We’ll tap into community wisdom and share ways to overcome tech-
nical challenges that people had to grind through, making our own experience
as pain-free as possible.
