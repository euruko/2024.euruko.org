          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            Ensuring smooth operation for thousands of users with regular work-
loads is hard. Using slot scheduling can help you make your work-
load and throughput more predictable and your users happy. Slot
scheduling is a great medicine to alleviate load spikes on your back-
ground jobs cluster.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            The traditional way of performing tasks for multiple users in the system is to
            schedule them using cron or similar. The issue however, is that scheduling “all
            the work for all the users” into one time slot will create a large load spike.
            This is bad for your shared services - the DB, Redis, APIs you call into - but
            also bad for your wallet, as you will need to suddenly scale your system by a
            factor when the time comes to run those jobs. In our company we need to run
            sync jobs to external APIs for every user - tens of thousands of users, and we
            want those jobs to run with predictable frequency. While we previously selected
            “least-recently-synced” workloads first, this came with the load spikes and all
            the accompanying issues.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            Slot scheduling tackles the problem differently. It computes a modulo over the
            workload owner ID (like the user ID) and then buckets the user into one of a
            fixed number of slots. This allows us to run an approximately even number
            of tasks at any given point in time, providing for a near-flat throughput. It is
            better for the shared services, better for the queue - as jobs get portioned into
            the job queue in smaller batches, and do not stick around for long - and better
            for autoscaling, as there is much less of it needed.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            We are also going to discuss a very viable strategy for designing systems like
            this - discrete simulations, which - when applied properly - can save hours of
            testing.

            Julik Tarkhanov is the director of engineering at Cheddar Payments, a fledging
fintech startup in the UK, where he is responsible for running the engineering
team and for a good handful of hands-on development. Prior he worked at
WeTransfer where he was responsible for file storage and infrastructure, and
before that - in the visual effects industry creating images that inspire and
befuddle. On his free time he explores weird user interfaces and plays bass
guitar and trumpet.
