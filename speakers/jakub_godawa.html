          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            We all do simulations in our heads, so why not make one in Ruby?
Something that we can observe, fast forward, or let it linger. Let’s
see how custom shared timers, threads, queues, and mutexes work
together, and how they can form a petrol station with optimal cost
and throughput.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            The cars are coming to a station. They want to get some fuel. They come
at different times and they need to be served. Just like web requests but this
time we’ll not do web development. This we do at work. So for fun we want
to build something that feels more alive. A small closed system that we could
fully control and derive further ideas from. This is how we start thinking about
simulators.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            The main idea of a simulation is that it happens in some programmable en-
vironment. First, we need to think about how to control time. If every piece
of the simulation, like a car or a station, runs in its own thread, then how do
we synchronize them? How to handle access into shared resources? What data
structures should we use?
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            Also, how do we create a protocol for gathering results to help us make decisions?
How do we write a config file for a simulator engine that can spawn multiple
scenarios in parallel? And last but not least, how do we visualize a simulation?
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            This presentation is a pure Ruby feast. We will operate on both MRI and JRuby
to see the differences in handling an increasing number of processes and threads.
And we will visualize the simulation in three different ways: with Gosu, Turbo
Frames, and console. And hopefully, we’ll write code that makes it easy to plug
in another kind of simulation.

            My name is Jakub. I come from Poland, and I’m 38 years old. I’ve been enjoying
programming for over 20 years now. Throughout my career, I’ve experienced a
couple of burnouts, but I’m hopeful that I have recovered from them. Outside
of programming, I am passionate about studying acting, psychology, and Indian
philosophy. Writing prose is another passion of mine, and I also practice boxing
regularly. For the majority of my career, I have been involved in full-stack development, whether it be within a company, independently, or managing a
small team. Currently, I am employed at Punkta, where I am involved in
developing an insurance comparison engine. My interest in computer simulators
was inherited from my dad and further developed through Arduino projects with
my uncle.
