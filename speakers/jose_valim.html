            While it has been more than a decade since I wrote my last line of
            Ruby code, there are lessons the Ruby community taught me that I
            have never forgotten. And the biggest of them is to always be open
            to new ideas. In this talk, I will present Livebook, which borrows
            from Python, Erlang, JavaScript, and more, and enables us to
            introspect systems at scale, build machine learning applications,
            and run web applications, and much more within minutes. I hope I
            will inspire the audience to explore new ideas within their daily
            tools.
