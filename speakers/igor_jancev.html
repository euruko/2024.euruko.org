            We all know Ruby and Rails are great tools for startups and fast development of
new applications. But did you know that the campus software of the Technical
University in Vienna is powered by a >380.000 LOC Ruby on Rails application
that was started in 2011 and is actively developed and maintained by a small,
dedicated team of Ruby developers ever since?

          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            A senior Ruby developer from this team shares patterns and solutions distilled
from more than 10 years of his work on this project, for example how the team
gradually migrated the Rails application from Rails 2.3 to Rails 6.1 and Hotwire
Turbo, how a big amount of data is kept in sync between the rails applications
and many other applications at the university, how to make big changes to the
code base without upsetting all users, and much more.

            Igor is a software engineer and CEO of MasteryBits AB. He was born in Sarajevo
and came to Austria as a refugee in 1993. In 1999 he graduated in computer
science at the Technical University in Vienna. After working as a Java developer
and architect for more than 10 years, he discovered and fell in love with Ruby
and Ruby on Rails and that made him quit his job as a Java architect and go
all in on Ruby. In 2013 he comes back to the Technical University in Vienna
to help upgrade and modernize a huge (now > 380.000 LOC) campus software
application written in Ruby on Rails. Nowadays, he works with his wife on an
innovative and easy to use knowledge management application.
