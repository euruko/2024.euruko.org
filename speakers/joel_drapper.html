          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            In this practical talk, you’ll learn how to use object-oriented
programming to create fast, maintainable UI components in pure Ruby
with Phlex.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            Ruby applications tend to end up with a spaghetti soup of HTML, ERB, Ruby
and Tailwind directives all muddled up and entangled in huge template files
that become increasingly difficult to test, debug and maintain over time.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            ViewComponent can help to unravel some of that, but it only goes so far. Now,
many teams — including GitHub (behind ViewComponent) — are turning the
view layer over to frontend JavaScript frameworks such as React.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            Despite this, I still believe that returning simple HTML documents from a simple
backend is the best way to build most web applications today — whether you’re
optimising for performance, developer productivity or long-term maintainability.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            This talk introduces Phlex, a new Ruby gem that brings component-based
architecture to the backend, enabling developers to create views that are fast,
maintainable and really fun to work with in pure Ruby.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            We’ll start by identifying common pain points in traditional approaches, such
as lack of encapsulation, difficult testing and poor performance.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            We’ll explore how Phlex addresses these issues by leveraging object-oriented
programming to create reusable, composable UI components.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            Through a series of real-world examples, you’ll learn how to:
          </p>
          <ul class="section__article__list mb--4">
            <li class="section__article__list__item is-accepted">
              Agradually refactor an existing Rails application;
            </li>
            <li class="section__article__list__item is-accepted">
              apply OOP patterns like inheritance and composition to your views;
            </li>
            <li class="section__article__list__item is-accepted">
              extract methods and objects, applying your existing Ruby refactoring skills
to a new domain;
            </li>
            <li class="section__article__list__item is-accepted">
              encapsulate view logic and helpers within components;
            </li>
            <li class="section__article__list__item is-accepted">
              yield interfaces to enable composition;
            </li>
            <li class="section__article__list__item is-accepted">
              test your components in isolation; and
            </li>
            <li class="section__article__list__item is-accepted">
              package components into reusable UI kit gems.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            We’ll also cover the trade-offs and challenges of caching the view layer, the
difference between views, layouts and components, and why you might want to
reconsider the lost art of streaming HTML.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            Finally, we’ll learn about the emergent capabilities of a view layer that
understands the structure of HTML documents, and how Phlex can help you write
safer, more accessible HTML.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            We’ll also learn about Selective Rendering and the kinds of things that become
possible when the frontend can ask the backend to render specific elements.
          </p>
          <p class="section__article__text mb--2">
            By the end of the talk, you’ll be equipped with a set of patterns and best
practices for building and maintaining component-based architectures in Ruby
applications, and you’ll have a solid foundation for using Phlex in your own
projects, as well as a new perspective on what’s possible with Ruby.
