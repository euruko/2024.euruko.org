# EuRuKo 2024 website

Placeholder website for EuRuKo 2024.

## Deploy

The site is deployed using GitHub actions. For the moment the `dist` folder is deployed as a static website but in the future the repo can be updated to use Bridgetown, Jekyll, or whatever frontend stack works best.

Workflows templates can be found here: <https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/tree/main/pages>
