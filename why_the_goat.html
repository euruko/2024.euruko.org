      <p class="section__text mb--2">
        The pitch we made for 2024 was for a G.O.A.T. EuRuKo, the greatest of all time of course, but also because of 
        the famous goat from Tuzla, BiH. Tuzla has a statue of a goat. We know, it's weird, but it has a valid story 
        behind it.
      </p>  
      <p class="section__text mb--2">
        During the time when Austria-Hungary occupied Tuzla, they forbade goats and ordered everyone to get rid of goats, 
        because they thought goats are harming forrests. Everyone did so, except one person who lived off of his goat. 
        This man defied the order and decided to hide the goat. With time word spread in the community that there is one 
        goat that is left, so they found the man and started buying milk and cheese from him. Basically, that one goat 
        ended up feeding the entire community. There is even have a famous saying that everyone in BiH knows: "The whole 
        of Tuzla milked one goat".
      </p>
      <p class="section__text mb--2">    
        Since this is the first time EuRuKo is coming to Bosnia and Herzegovina, it's gonna take on what that one goat 
        represents for us, as it is going to feed a community of Ruby developers and enthusiasts that havenâ€™t had an 
        opportunity to attend such a conference before.
      </p>
      <p class="section__text mb--2">   
        Since EuRuKo is also going to be the first-ever Ruby conference in the country, just as the goat was in Tuzla, 
        it is going to be the only Ruby conference available to feed this community.
