---

As we are approaching the start of the new year, we want to share with you the timeline for 2024, for EuRuKo, so you know what to expect.

We expect to open the CfP in the next few weeks, during January. It should stay open 3-4 months.
Our CfP team will review all submitted talks and notify all speakers.
Every selected speaker will be a guest in Hotel Hills from 10-14 of September, covered by the organizing team, and will not have to pay for the conference ticket. If the speaker pays for a ticket, it will be refunded. If a speaker already books accommodation with hotel Hills, we will find a way of replacing booked accommodation with one of the rooms set aside for speakers.
Speakers and the agenda will be revealed shortly after the selection of speakers.

The invited speakers will be revealed as soon as the team finishes their selection.
Fun fact: we already have a few speakers that we invited.

Travel instructions will be released in the following months as well, this location should be extremely easy to get to with the well-connected Sarajevo airport, the train and bus connections.

We will look to start selling tickets around February.
According to current budget projections, for a five-star congress and thermal spa resort in Bosnia & Herzegovina the tickets will be something like:
- Early-Bird 150 EUR (+ VAT)
- Regular 200 EUR (+ VAT)
- Company 250 EUR (+ VAT) -> includes invoice correction support
- Regular Support 250 EUR (+ VAT) -> for all Ruby heroes that want to support us
- Online 50 EUR (+ VAT) -> virtual/networking platform access, streaming access, non-refundable

Since we are not looking to turn a profit on this conference, but rather to simply make a G.O.A.T. EuRuKo experience and cover our operational costs, if we get quality support from sponsors and the sponsors cover a good chunk or most of our costs, the tickets will naturally cost less.

All in-person tickets provide you with full access to the three days of the conference, all lectures, networking events & parties, 3 lunches, all coffee breaks that are part of the conference and access to a conference platform.

The online tickets provide you with full access to a conference platform, where you will be able to see all talks streamed, interact with other participants and speakers. Online tickets support us in funding the production team that will provide streaming services and production for multiple tracks during the conference.

Our goal for 2024 is to gather 700 Ruby enthusiasts from all over the world.
However, one exciting thing about Hills is that the conference can scale there without losing quality. If we notice we can reach a 1000 participants we are open to expanding.

Depending on our costs and tickets sold moving forward, we will explore options of collaborating with different NGOs and community conferences in the country and in the region, to lower costs for students and young professionals keen on learning about Ruby and networking with some the best experts from the Ruby community and the general IT community and to fill our capacities at the hotel Hills convention center to the maximum possible.

We are looking forward to celebrating Ruby in 2024 with you.
