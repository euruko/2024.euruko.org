text: In our best efforts to support everyone who wants to join EuRuKo 2024 in Bosnia & Herzegovina, we have made the difficult decision of moving the conference from Tuzla to Sarajevo. The dates will be kept the same, 11-12-13 of September, just the location is going to change. Venue for the conference will be Hotel Hills, which is 2km away from the well-connected Sarajevo airport. This five-star thermal spa resort is home to the most modern congress center in the country and, together with its sister Hotel Hollywood, it can host up to 700 guests. Nearby hotels also exist which have similar capacities. Hopefully this solves all of the travel concerns for our beloved Ruby community and helps you in your decision to visit Bosnia & Herzegovina for EuRuKo in 2024.

We hope this solves all of the travel & accommodation concerns for our beloved Ruby community and helps you in your decision to visit Bosnia & Herzegovina for EuRuKo in 2024.

For everyone that wanted to visit Tuzla, we will do our best to organize a few busses for the day after the conference, if our budget allows for it, to take you to visit the Panonnian Lakes, the city and to take a selfie with the famous Tuzla goat.
