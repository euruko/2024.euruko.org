      <p class="section__text mb--4">
        EuRuKo (European Ruby Konferenz) is the largest and longest running annual Ruby conference in Europe that brings 
        you all the good news about Ruby and its friends. Every year it takes place in a different European city, the 
        location being chosen by participants.
      </p>

      <h4 class="section__subtitle">Keep EuRuKo affordable</h4>
      <p class="section__text mb--4">
        Thereâ€™s a long tradition to keep EuRuKo tickets as affordable as possible to offer everyone the opportunity to 
        attend and sponsors are an essential part of this.
      </p>
      <h4 class="section__subtitle">Good for your company, good for the community</h4>
      <p class="section__text mb--2">
        Sponsoring EuRuKo gets you the opportunity to reach an international group of talented and passionate developers. 
        EuRuKo is the biggest gathering of Ruby enthusiasts in Europe and one of the biggest in the world.
      </p>
      <p class="section__text mb--2">
        Are you looking to hire Ruby (and not just Ruby!) developers in your company or initiative? Then you've probably 
        looked into hiring a headhunter to find you the talent that you need. And you saw how much it costs. Most headhunters 
        are looking for half a years' salary! By sponsoring EuRuKo, you're not only investing a fraction of the price of a 
        headhunter, but you're getting to meet enthusiastic developers in the flesh, and by the numbers!
      </p>
      <p class="section__text mb--2">
        The above goes without saying how you'd contribute to a lively Ruby community from around Europe (and the world)!
      </p>
      <h4 class="section__subtitle">Payment options</h4>
      <p class="section__text mb--2">
        Sponsorships can be paid for by SWIFT bank transfer.
